# Asset Management Workflow Updates - Complete Summary

**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Changes Made:** Complete workflow restructuring from direct federal approval to multi-tier ministry-based approval

---

## 🎯 New Workflow Architecture

### Previous Workflow (❌ DEPRECATED)

```
Uploader → Approver → Federal Admin (DIRECT APPROVAL)
```

### New Workflow (✅ IMPLEMENTED)

```
Uploader → Approver → Ministry Admin → Federal Admin
   |          |           |              |
 pending   approve &    review &      final
 (status)  send to      approve/      approval
           ministry      reject
```

---

## 📊 Asset Status Types

### Updated AssetStatus Type

**File:** `src/types/asset.types.ts`

```typescript
export type AssetStatus =
  | "pending"
  | "pending_ministry_review"
  | "approved"
  | "rejected";
```

**Status Flow:**

- `pending` → Awaiting approver review (initial upload)
- `pending_ministry_review` → Approver approved, sent to ministry admin for final review
- `approved` → Ministry admin approved, ready for federal submission
- `rejected` → Rejected at either approver or ministry level

---

## 🔄 Asset Approval Workflow Fields

### New Asset Fields Added

**File:** `src/types/asset.types.ts`

```typescript
// Approver action
approvedBy?: string;                  // Agency approver user ID
approvedAt?: Timestamp;               // When approver approved it
sentToMinistryAdminBy?: string;       // Which approver sent it
sentToMinistryAdminAt?: Timestamp;    // When sent to ministry

// Ministry Admin action
approvedByMinistry?: string;          // Ministry admin user ID
approvedByMinistryAt?: Timestamp;     // When ministry admin approved

// Rejection tracking
rejectedBy?: string;                  // Who rejected it
rejectedAt?: Timestamp;
rejectionReason?: string;
rejectionLevel?: 'approver' | 'ministry-admin' | 'federal-admin'; // Track rejection source
```

**Audit Trail:** All timestamps and user IDs are recorded for complete accountability

## 📝 Service Layer Updates

### New Functions in `asset.service.ts`

#### 1. **getAssetsForMinistryReview()**

```typescript
export const getAssetsForMinistryReview = async (ministryId: string): Promise<Asset[]>
```

- Gets assets with status `pending_ministry_review`
- Ministry admins use this to see what needs their approval
- Filters by ministry automatically

#### 2. **getAllMinistryAssets()**

```typescript
export const getAllMinistryAssets = async (ministryId: string): Promise<Asset[]>
```

- Gets ALL assets (all statuses) for a ministry
- Used by ministry admin to see complete asset inventory
- Includes pending, approved, and rejected assets

#### 3. **approveAssetByMinistry()**

```typescript
export const approveAssetByMinistry = async (
  assetId: string,
  ministryAdminId: string,
  ministryAdminEmail?: string,
  agencyName?: string
): Promise<void>
```

- Ministry admin approves an asset
- Sets status to `approved`
- Records approver info and timestamp
- Logs action in audit trail

#### 4. **rejectAssetByMinistry()**

```typescript
export const rejectAssetByMinistry = async (
  assetId: string,
  ministryAdminId: string,
  rejectionReason: string,
  ministryAdminEmail?: string,
  agencyName?: string
): Promise<void>
```

- Ministry admin rejects an asset
- Sets status to `rejected`
- Records rejection reason and level
- Logs action with details

#### 5. **Updated approveAsset()**

- NOW sends to `pending_ministry_review` instead of directly approving
- Records both approver and ministry admin tracking fields
- Audit log notes: "sent to Ministry Admin"

#### 6. **Updated rejectAsset()**

- Added `rejectionLevel` parameter to track who rejected it
- Can be called by approver or ministry admin

## 📋 Audit Trail Records

- `userEmail`: Their email
- `agencyName`: Their ministry/agency
- `userRole`: Their role
- `action`: Type of action (asset.upload, asset.approve, asset.reject, etc.)
- `timestamp`: When it happened
- `details`: Description of what happened
- `metadata`: Additional context (asset IDs, values, reasons, etc.)

### Example Log Entries

```
1. Uploader uploads asset:
   Action: asset.upload
   Details: "Uploaded asset: Toyota Corolla (Motor Vehicle)"

2. Approver approves and sends to ministry:
   Action: asset.approve
   Details: "Approved asset and sent to Ministry Admin: Toyota Corolla (AE-23-001)"

3. Ministry admin approves final:
   Action: asset.approve_by_ministry
   Details: "Approved asset at Ministry level: Toyota Corolla (AE-23-001)"

4. Ministry admin rejects:
   Action: asset.reject_by_ministry
   Details: "Rejected asset at ministry level: Toyota Corolla - Reason: Missing depreciation details"

## 🚀 Routes Updated

### New Route Added

- **Route:** `/assets/view-uploads`
- **Component:** `ViewUploadsPage.tsx`
- **Protection:** ProtectedRoute + RoleBasedRoute
- **Allowed Roles:** `agency`, `agency-approver`

### Updated Routes

- `/dashboard` - Shows role-based dashboard (includes stats about pending ministry reviews for admins)
- `/ministry-admin/dashboard` - Now shows 3 asset tabs instead of just approved assets

## 🔧 Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes

1. **Asset Status Values Changed**
   - Old: `pending` → `approved` → (Federal Admin sees it)
   - New: `pending` → `pending_ministry_review` → `approved` → (Federal Admin sees it)
   - Migration: Existing `approved` assets should be left as-is or marked as `approved`

2. **Approver Role Changes**
   - Old: Approver could mark assets as fully `approved`
   - New: Approver now sends to `pending_ministry_review` for ministry admin review

### Data Considerations

- Existing assets with status `approved` are valid and don't need changes
- Audit logs will have new action types for ministry-level operations
- No database migration required - new fields are optional and back-compatible
